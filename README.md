# On-Call
This group project assists coordinators by quickly and easily scheduling Resident Assistant on call shifts for the term. _On Call_ considers resident assistants’ preferences for weekday shifts, unavailability for weekend shifts, up to one RA that will be given all their preferences (the ‘gold star’ RA), and up to two pairs of RAs that should not be scheduled together (the ‘bad pairings’ RAs). Based on these inputs, the program distributes the number of weekday, weekend, primary, and secondary shifts each RA is assigned.
